# ESAP 2019: Complex Networks
Engineering Summer Academy at Penn. For three weeks, I worked on building network models. My final project for the course involved optimizing initial seeds for a viral marketing campaign and simulating the spreading behavior in Python. There are two spreading models featured: decision-based model, and the SIS model.
